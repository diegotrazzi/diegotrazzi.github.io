## Big(O)

If the running time of an algorithm is $O(f(n))$, it means that the running time grows at most linearly with $f(n)$. For example, if we say an algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n)$, it means that in the worst case, the algorithmâ€™s running time increases linearly with the size of the input.
