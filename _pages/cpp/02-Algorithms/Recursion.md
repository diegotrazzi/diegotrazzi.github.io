## Recursion, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming

> :warning: **Tail recurion:** many compilers and interpreters can optimize tail recursive calls to reuse the current methodâ€™s stack frame for the next call, effectively transforming the recursion into iteration and dramatically reducing space requirements.

### Recursion Cost

:warning: The general form of cost for a divide-and-conquer recurrence relation is:

$$
T(n) = a*T\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + f(n)
$$

Where:

- $T(n)$ is the time complexity for an input size $n$.
- $a$ is the **number of subproblems** (how many times the problem is divided).
- $b$ is the **factor by which the problem size is reduced** for each subproblem.
- $O(n^d)$ represents the **cost of dividing the problem** and combining the solutions (this is the non-recursive work done).
